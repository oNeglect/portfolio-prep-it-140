The repository showcases basic understanding of Python concepts and ideas. The concepts include functions within Python and how they are implemented to create robust and efficient programs. There are practices of logic and reason that use if statements to suggest conditions within the framework. The use of dictionaries is also applied to describe the data structure and its various functions.

The Python code also demonstrates best practices for code commenting, indentation, and a slew of other features that, to some extent, promote formal and efficient code.
