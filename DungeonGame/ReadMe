Game created that allows user to traverse map by collecting various items. 
Each room has a specific item, and the user must command the character to pick the item up
if the item exists in the room. One room has the dungeon monster, and if the player goes into
the room without having collected all of the items, the game ends, and the player must start over.
If the player collects all of the items, and runs into the room, then the player wins the game.
The player can move north, south, east, or west. If the move the player wants to move is not valid,
system must be able to account for this. The system must be able to account for all inputs from user as well.
